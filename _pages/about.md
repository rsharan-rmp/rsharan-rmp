I am a **Robotics Controls Lead** and a **Georgia Tech Ph.D.** specializing in **Autonomous Surgical Intervention**, **Embodied AI**, and **Real-time Control**. 

My research bridges the gap between rigorous control theory and real-world deployment. Currently, I lead a multidisciplinary engineering team in industry, deploying **GPU-accelerated perception** and **autonomous navigation** on Edge-AI hardware.

### Research Thrusts
* **Medical Robotics:** Design and control of steerable micro-scale surgical robots.
* **Physical AI:** Real-time perception-action loops for autonomous intervention.
* **Variable Stiffness:** Leveraging material science for safer surgical tool navigation.

### Professional Highlights
* **7 First-author publications** (Nature Portfolio, IEEE RA-L, IROS, ICRA).
* **Provisional Patent** (GTRC/9166) for variable stiffness surgical robotics.
* **Topping Fellow:** Recognized as the top 5% of Georgia Tech PhDs by citation impact.
* **Invited Speaker:** Harvard Medical School (NCIGT) 2023.

### Industry Leadership
As a Controls Engineer at a high-growth UAV startup, I manage the deployment of real-time control systems on **NVIDIA Jetson** platforms using **ROS2** and **TensorRT**, moving research from simulation to field-ready hardware.
